# Hangman Game

Welcome to the Hangman Game! This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic word-guessing game. Challenge your word-guessing skills and have fun trying to figure out the hidden word before it's too late!

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly select a word, and you'll see underscores representing each letter of the word.
2. Guess letters one at a time. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed; otherwise, a part of the hangman figure will be drawn.
3. Keep guessing letters until you either successfully guess the entire word or the hangman figure is complete.
4. Have fun and enjoy the game!
